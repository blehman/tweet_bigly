        <i>The New York Times</i> recently published an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html" target="_blank">article</a> chronicling Trump’s oft-used mode of communication, Twitter.
        <br></br>
        Beginning at the escalator descent of 2015—the memorable unveiling of his intention to court presidential candidacy—we dissect Trump's Twitter insults targeting Muslims, Mexicans, women, the LGBT community, Hillary Clinton and more.

        A president’s words can ripple across the globe, which lends artful political discourse a reason to employ a carefully crafted practice. Each phrase can be weighed to seek understanding, intent, and meaning.

        In this matrix of nodes, each dot depicts a single insult from Trump’s personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump.

        Since June 2015, Trump has logged over 2,200 insults on Twitter.

        Over 300 people, places and things were victims of Trump’s Twitter taunts, scoffs and snubs. His new title as the President of the United States has failed to stem the tide of insult-containing Tweets from Trump’s personal account. At last count he had 24.8 million followers.

        The lion's share of Trump's insults were directed toward U.S. politicians, with myriad news organizations and reporters coming in at a close second.

        Hillary Clinton received the brunt of Trump’s Twitter insults, receiving 430 attacks—20 percent of total insults examined in this data set. Prior to becoming the Republican nominee, Trump frequently lashed out at his party opponents, quickly stamping each politician with a moniker such as “Lyin’ Ted,” “Little Marco,” and “Low Energy Jeb”—nicknames that Trump propagated on Twitter and throughout his campaign.
        <br></br>
        Mainstream media outlets—particularly The New York Times and CNN—were also targets. Trump often called such organizations “dishonest,” “bias,” and in The New York Time’s case, “failing.” Subscribers to the publication are over 3 million—a record-high readership.
        <br></br>
        Trump even devoted four Tweets (which contained 12 insults) to bashing Saturday Night Live’s response to the presidency.
