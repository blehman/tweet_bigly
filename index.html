        <i>The New York Times</i> has an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html" target="_blank">article</a> commemorating Trump's continued use of what may well be his favorite social cocktail: Tweet-infused insults.<br/><br/>
        Our epoch begins at 2015's Trump Tower escalator descent, where we pick up on Trump discussing rivals, Muslims, Mexicans, women, the LGBT community, and more. As the story unfolds, we explore content from Twitter's linguistic-artisan-in-chief.

        <div class="title">Trump Slings Insults</div>
        Dignity, honor, integrity—these are great topics, but not the present thread. Each of the nodes in this graph represent an insult directly sent from Trump's personal Twitter account.
        Trump has publicly logged over 2,200 insults on Twitter since he announced his candidacy in June, 2015.

        <div class="title">Categorical Insults</div>
        The lion's share of Trump's insults were directed at news organisations and politicians.

        <div class="title">Insult Recipients</div>
        On Twitter, Trump fulminated on over 300 people, places, organizations, and inanimate objects—all while wearing respectable titles such as Presidential Candidate, President Elect, and ultimately President of the United States. Trump continues to find new targets.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Individual Targets</div>
        Several individuals and organizations stand out as prized insult targets. Among them, Hillary Clinton received the most of Trump's attention; she raked in over 430 verbal attacks (that's 20% of the total). <i>The New York Times</i> was top among the news world, but as the graph shows, they were not alone; The Donald has consistently looked down upon the media. Bernie came into focus after Trump trounced his repubican rivals. The final graph on this page shows Trump finding time at the start of his presidency to criticize SNL.

        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.

        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        <div class="title">Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div>
        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
