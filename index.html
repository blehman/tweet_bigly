        <i>The New York Times</i> recently published an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html" target="_blank">article</a> chronicling Trump’s oft-used mode of communication, Twitter.
        <br></br>
        Beginning at the escalator descent of 2015—the memorable unveiling of his intention to court presidential candidacy—we dissect Trump's Twitter insults targeting Muslims, Mexicans, women, the LGBT community, Hillary Clinton and more.

        A president’s words can ripple across the globe, which lends artful political discourse a reason to employ a carefully crafted practice. Each phrase can be weighed to seek understanding, intent, and meaning.

        In this matrix of nodes, each dot depicts a single insult from Trump’s personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump.

        Since June 2015, Trump has logged over 2,200 insults on Twitter.

        Over 300 people, places and things were victims of Trump’s Twitter taunts, scoffs and snubs. His new title as the President of the United States has failed to stem the tide of insult-containing Tweets from Trump’s personal account. At last count he had 24.8 million followers.

        The lion's share of Trump's insults were directed toward U.S. politicians, with myriad news organizations and reporters coming in at a close second.

        Hillary Clinton received the brunt of Trump’s Twitter insults, receiving 430 attacks—20 percent of total insults. Prior to becoming the Republican nominee, Trump frequently lashed out at his party opponents, quickly labeling each politician with a moniker such as “Lyin’ Ted,” “Little Marco,” and “Low Energy Jeb”—nicknames that Trump propagated on Twitter and repeated throughout his campaign. Mainstream media outlets were also targets. Trump often called such organizations “dishonest” and “bias.” Trump even devoted 12 insults to bashing Saturday Night Live’s response to the presidency.

        <div class="title">Individuals per Insult Count</div>
        Trump masterfully employed his Twitter insults to repudiate opponents. While he insulted over 260 folks only once, some were targeted multiple times, such as his Republican rivals and especially Hillary Clinton—the outlier in this graph far right.
